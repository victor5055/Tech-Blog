 # Repository-Description
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
This app utilizes many different files, database storage, and technologies to create a Tech blog. A user can view any blogs on the main page and click them to see the comments. Both the post and comments will show who posted them.

If a user would like to create their own blog they can sign up to create an account or login to an existing one. Once logged in they now have access to a dashboard for posting blogs. They can also go to other blogs and comment on them leaving their name and a date.

The user then can logout and end their session or a timeout exists on the session as well.
